in lesson 2 we learn to hide the info to save the app from potential threts for example X-Powered-By: Express include by default and we can hide that, to mitigate this risk, you can remove the X-Powered-By header using the helmet.hidePoweredBy() middleware.

in lesson 3 we learn to get protect from clickjacking attacks where a malicious site can embed your webpage inside an <iframe> without your consent. This could trick users into interacting with your site in unintended ways (e.g., clicking hidden buttons that execute harmful actions)
To prevent this, you should use Helmetâ€™s frameguard middleware to set the X-Frame-Options HTTP header. This tells browsers not to allow your site to be embedded in an <iframe>, thereby preventing clickjacking attacks.
